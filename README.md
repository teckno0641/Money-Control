# Money-Control

I made this Web Application in order to manage my personal finances. with this, i can do the following:
1. Assign money entry types, example: Salary, Profits
2. Assign expense types, example: Payments, Bills
3. Assign starting money, the numbers will be shown as a graphic at the main screen of the app
4. If you have some debts, they will display as red in the graphic
5. If you enter an expense, money will be taken from the total money in the application
6. All the money movements will be in a registry

At first, this app was supposed to be used with Cordova to generate an application for smartphones, but i have an iphone, so i rather have it as a web app in order to use it from any device.
